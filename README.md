# Circle Inception

The purpose of this project is to exactly implement what can be seen in the following
video: <https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xq6o27>.

After having run `npm install`, just run `npm run dev` to start the React / Next.js local server for
development. That server is accessible via `http://localhost:3000`.
